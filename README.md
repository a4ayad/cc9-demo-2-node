You've created and published your package to NPM, now we need to make it robust and usable. You will build a command line version of your resume. 

Convert your written professional resume into an object. 

Update your project so anyone can pull your new node package and run: 

$ npx <some command name> 

and it displays your nicely formatted resume in the command line. 

Tag your project as v1.2.0 

Tag your project in Github as version 1.2.0 

Push your package to npm 

Open your terminal (anywhere) 

type in $ npx <some command name>
