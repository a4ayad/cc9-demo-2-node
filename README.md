# Code Challenge 9: The NPM Resume 
## Instructions
You've created and published your package to NPM, now we need to make it robust and usable. You will build a command line version of your resume. 

Convert your written professional resume into an object. 

Update your project so anyone can pull your new node package and run: 

$ npx <some command name> 

and it displays your nicely formatted resume in the command line. 

Tag your project as v1.2.0 

Tag your project in Github as version 1.2.0 

Push your package to npm 

Open your terminal (anywhere) 

type in $ npx <some command name>  

Confirm it works as expected 

Submit the follow: 

You Github repo 

You npm url 

the name of your command 
(whatever your called <some command name>) 

My work:

Starting point of the project which creates your package.json file. 


$ npm init 

$ yarn add express 

The above command creates node_modules/ folder if it doesnâ€™t exist and adds express to package.json file. 

$ node index.mjs 

The above command should display the content of console.log() from index.mjs.
