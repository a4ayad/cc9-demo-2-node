## Instructions
Code Challenge 10: The API Resume 

You're made a command-line version of your resume, now it's time to build the api version with express. 

Added a `server` file [server.mjs] that brings in express and serves a route (name the route the same name you gave your npx command. 

Add a home route ("/"). It should give instructions on how to use your api and promote your command-line resume. 

Export your postman collection and save it to your project.

Push your project to Github (remember to ignore node_modules directory) 

Deploy your app to Heroku

### My work:

Created new github branch cc10-api-ahmed-resume under demo-2-node. 

https://github.com/a4ayad/demo-2-node/tree/cc10-api-ahmed-resume 

Starting point of the project which creates your package.json file. 

$ node --version
v15.3.0

$ npm --version
6.14.11

$ npm init 

$ yarn add express 

The above command creates node_modules/ folder if it doesnâ€™t exist and adds express to package.json file. 

$ node index.mjs 

The above command should display the content of console.log() from index.mjs. 


### Heroku

Downloaded and installed 64-bit installer Heroku from https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli for Windows
